This is a Car Sale API.
Here users after auntheticating can provide their car infos and the API will show an estimated price based on their car configurations! Besides If the seller sells the car in a higher or lower price he or she can submit a report for that to help the api to give more accurate results to the upcoming customer of this API.

Here I have uses NEST JS along with type safety and cookie features so that it becomes good!.
