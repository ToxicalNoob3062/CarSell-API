This is a **Car Sale API**.
Here users after auntheticating can provide their car infos and the API will show an estimated price based on their car configurations! Besides If the seller sells the car in a higher or lower price he or she can submit a report for that to help the api to give more accurate results to the upcoming customer of this API.

Here I have uses **NEST JS** along with type safety and cookie features so that it becomes good!.

**Disclaimer:** If none makes request for a long time the server will go to an idle state! So if you are the first to send back req to that idle server it may take couples of seconds to respin the backend container. But after that all you subsequent requests will be executed in ms. âš¡ðŸ˜Ž
